# IPA - Introduction to MSOT and PriceSync workflows

### IPA Team Scope & Responsibilities

- Team handles more than just document understanding/extraction
- Current focus areas:

- Document understanding (classification/extraction from POs and invoices)
- Modernizing UI Path ML models to LLMs
- Regular process automation workflows
- Managed Services Order Trust (MSOT) portal automation
- Price Sync workflow automation

### MSOT Workflow Overview

- Managed services = value-added service for exchange customers

- Customers pay for research on PO placement issues, missing acknowledgments, invoice problems
- Alternative to self-service tools for customers preferring hands-off approach
- Current automation scope:

- Email correlation to corresponding purchase orders
- Basic PO validation and automatic acknowledgment generation
- POA/855 documents provide delivery assurance to customers

### Price Sync Workflow Details

- Value-added service alerting providers to overpayments

- Compares actual payments vs purchase agreements between hospitals/vendors
- Weekly reports sent to providers
- Leverages historical PO and agreement data
- Current state (UI-based automation):

- Downloads reports from Nuvia, Exchange applications, CDP S3 files
- Bot logs into applications like human (Okta authentication, date range selection)
- Generates 50 decks weekly for 50 providers (Fridays 1:30-6:00 IST)
- Creates 15-16 slide presentations covering:

1. Spend categories and exception rates
2. Agreement vs actual comparisons
3. Item-wise and vendor-wise spend analysis
4. Historical data from last 7 weeks (stored in RDS)
- Two deck versions:

- Light version (reduced slides for package customers)
- Full version (complete 15-16 slide analysis)

### Data Sources & Applications

- Nuvia application:

- Legacy content solution (20-25 years old)
- Item master enrichment with attributes (latex content, sizing, unit counts)
- Helps customers avoid ERP-level maintenance overhead
- Provides HCPCS/spec codes for reimbursements
- Data Connect:

- Modern replacement for Nuvia (5-6 years development)
- Cloud-focused, similar enrichment functionality
- Some customers still on Nuvia, others migrated to Data Connect
- Exchange application:

- Source for price exception data
- Three-point validation: PO, POA/invoice, contract price
- Flags mismatches as contract/price exceptions

### Future State & Next Steps

- Eliminating manual configuration processes:

- Moving from spreadsheet configs to EBI console
- Delivery managers can update configurations directly
- Data source consolidation:

- CDP/EBI team providing S3 bucket access
- Eliminating UI-based report downloads from Exchange/Nuvia
- IPA will focus on deck generation and email distribution
- Business impact achieved:

- 40% headcount reduction in managed services team
- Eliminated data disclosure issues from manual processes
- Continue discussion in-person Wednesday in Hyderabad

- Explore Nuvia team technical architecture meeting
- Scott owns Nuvia and CDP systems
