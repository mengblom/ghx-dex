4. **You just wrapped up 16 years at Verizon in January - what prompted the move and what are you looking for in your next role?**
    -

### Background & Technical Fit (12 minutes)
5. **This role is specifically for healthcare technology - you come from telecom. What interests you about the healthcare domain, and how do you think about ramping up on a new industry?**
    - *(Not asked)*

6. **At Verizon you worked on some impressive AI/LLM projects - AWS Bedrock, RAG pipelines, agentic workflows. Walk me through one of those projects and your specific contributions to the architecture?**
    - **AI Initiative for Database Production Support:**
        - Problem: DB production support team monitoring 250+ servers, taking long time to resolve tickets
        - Initial approach: Used in-house LLM with RAG (knowledge base) → created hallucination problems (wrong data)
        - Pivoted: Collaborated with AI engineering team and data science team
        - Solution: AWS Bedrock with agentic autonomous flow
            - Bedrock provides the LLM
            - Used agents to ensure correct data responses
            - Implemented vector database as knowledge base
            - Added filter/content guardrails in Bedrock to control hallucination
            - Implemented human-in-the-loop for data validation and security
            - Data governance and security focus
    - **Rapidly prototyped and deployed to production in 6 months**
    - AWS Bedrock is managed, scalable, helps with security and data governance

7. **You've optimized database performance extensively - Oracle, Cassandra, Databricks pipelines. What's your typical approach when an application team comes to you saying "our queries are slow"?**
    - Adaptive query execution (fine tuning method)
    - Z-ordering indexing
    - Optimize Delta data
    - Working closely with database team
    - Caching techniques
    - For AI area: Query fine-tuning for LLMs, data governance, security

8. **The JD mentions we're looking for someone who works side-by-side with application engineers, not in isolation. How have you typically engaged with application teams at Verizon - are you more embedded or more consultative?**
    - **Consultative across the org**
    - Works with multiple teams simultaneously:
        - Java development team (application side) - still supported before leaving
        - 5-person production team (assigns tickets, triages)
        - AI initiative team for database optimization
        - Business stakeholders and product managers
    - Works closely with business stakeholders and product managers to lay down roadmap and initiatives
    - Gets on calls with customers when there are escalations

### Role Fit & Approach (8 minutes)
9. **We're transitioning to autonomous, stream-aligned teams where application engineers need to make sound data decisions independently. How would you enable teams to be self-sufficient while maintaining good architectural standards?**
    - *(Not asked)*

10. **This role requires PostgreSQL expertise - I see strong Oracle and SQL Server background on your resume. What's your PostgreSQL experience, and how quickly do you typically ramp on a new database technology?**
    - *(Not asked)*

11. **You've led architectural committees and mentored engineers on advanced topics. How do you balance being hands-on with technical work versus enabling and educating others?**
    - *(Not asked)*

### Closing (5 minutes)
12. **What's most important to you in your next engineering leadership role - what would make this a great fit for you?**
    - Emphasized flexibility: able to work on Java development side as well as AI initiatives
    - Wants company going toward AI direction
    - *(Not deeply explored)*

13. **What questions do you have about the role, the team, or GHX?**
    - **How does this role interact with the 10-12 agile teams?** Is it part of one team or across teams?
        - Answer: Reports directly to me, consultative role across all teams
        - Context: Monolithic architecture needs to be broken apart (mentioned strangler fig)
        - Problem: Multiple systems/components talking to same databases
        - Currently stuck on MongoDB for everything (not always the right choice)
        - Teams need help picking and choosing where to store data
    - **What cloud platform are we using?**
        - Answer: AWS
        - Victor's reaction: Similar to Verizon, majority of their deployments in AWS
    - **Are there any AI initiatives?**
        - Answer: Yes, leaning in heavily on both agentic/LLM-assisted development and product initiatives
        - Victor's response: AWS Bedrock is managed, scalable, quickly prototyped and rolled to production in 6 months
    - **What stack does the legacy monolith use?**
        - Answer: Mostly .NET
        - Victor's response: Similar to us (Java), took 6 months to plan and slowly roll out, lots of meetings and planning, achieved 30% performance improvement, CI/CD helped with deployment

## Notes

**Strengths:**
- Very experienced (26+ years total, 16 at Verizon)
- Broad technical background: Java, Python, AWS, microservices, data pipelines
- Has worked on relevant technologies: AWS Bedrock, RAG, vector databases, Databricks, event-driven architecture
- Hands-on and takes ownership (production support, customer escalations)
- Experience with modernization (J2EE → Spring Boot, strangler fig pattern, zero-downtime migration)
- Worked across multiple teams and with business stakeholders

**Concerns:**
- **Depth vs. Breadth:** Seems to lean heavily on 16 years of institutional knowledge at Verizon rather than deep technical expertise
- **Database Team Role:** Mentioned multiple times "worked closely with the database team" - this role needs someone who ***was on*** (or ideally ***ran***) the database team, not someone who collaborated with them
- **Application-Focused:** Conversation constantly went to application layer rather than data layer - when asked about databases, talked more about the applications using them
- **Limited Deep Database Expertise:** No PostgreSQL experience, limited depth on database internals, schema design, or advanced optimization techniques beyond "worked with DB team"
- **Communication:** Somewhat unclear at times, hard to follow, repeated himself frequently
    - Misunderstood context (e.g., asked if role is cross-org after I explained it was)
- **Data Architecture vs. Application Architecture:** Background is more application development with data components, not true data architecture role
- **NoSQL Confusion:** Described Cassandra as source of data from "downstream systems" but couldn't clearly explain the data flow or architecture
- **Consultative vs. Embedded:** Role needs someone who can dive deep and be hands-on with teams, not just consultative

**Product Context:**
- Worked on Verizon B2B e-commerce site for enterprise customers to order phones/plans
- Had special features like VIP entry with third-party vendors, reporting, customization for business customers
