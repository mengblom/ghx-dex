1. Why we are here today
	1. We are moving too slowly
		1. Monthly releases
		2. Huge batched changes
		3. 2+ week testing cycles
	2. It all comes back to the monolith
		1. Difficult code base
		2. Lots of dependencies
		3. Unpredictable side effects
		4. Difficult to test individual components
	3. Leads to:
		1. Huge releases
		2. Lots of end-to-end / UI tests (brittle difficult to maintain)
		3. Very long test cycles
		4. Leads to even larger releases
		5. ...
	4. ...
2. The cost of our current state
	1. For Engineering Teams
		1. Slow feedback loops
		2. Things that should be easy are now high risk and difficult
		3. Coordination overhead
		4. Lack of autonomy
	2. For Product & Customers
		1. Poor deployment frequency
		2. Long lead time for changes
		3. Slow incident remediation
		4. Delayed security fixes
		5. Cannot respond quickly to customer needs
3. The vision: Autonomous Teams
	1. Clear ownership boundaries
	2. Teams **build, deploy, and operate independently**
	3. Well-defined, **loosely coupled** areas of ownership
	4. Clear product partnership per team
	5. **Teams can ship on their own cadence** 
	6. All work in one place (Jira)
4. The approach / Strategy
	1. Reverse Conway Maneuver
	2. Shape team boundaries to match the system design we want
		1. Areas of ownership
		2. Component boundaries / loose coupling
		3. Each team owns clear domain boundaries
		4. Teams can deploy independently
		5. Reduced coordination overhead
5. New Team Topology
	1. Product Teams (stream aligned teams):
		1. Exchange IO 
		2. Exchange Core
		3. Exchange Analytics
		4. Exchange Actions & Rules
		5. Exchange Mapping
		6. Exchange Customer Enablement (current Mapping)
		7. Exchange Document Understanding
		8. Exchange Customer Visibility
		9. Organizations Platform
		10. Users Platform
		11. Continuity Assure
	2. Enabling Teams:
		1. Developer Platform & AI Enablement
		2. Data Architecture & Engineering
	3. Complicated Subsystem Teams:
		1. Exchange Performance Environment
6. Team Model / How your team will operate
	1. Dedicated EM (player-coach)
	2. Each team/product will have their own SDLC
	3. Easier to adhere to "standard" agile
	4. 
7. Coordination / Planning / Roadmaps / Product
8. "Marching orders"
	1. Work aggressively towards autonomy
	2. Cloud native
	3. AI-native / agentic development
	4. Demonstrate: clear ownership, independent deployment, operational readiness
9. Org structure
	1. These are bigger and deeper changes, more audacious goals than just KTLO 
	2. Need deeper involvement from in each area -> narrower focus
		1. One EM per team
		2. Narrower Director responsibilities
		3. Help from enabling teams
