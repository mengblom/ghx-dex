# Interview: Jeff Sherard for Principal Software Engineer - Data

**Date:** 2026-04-06  
**Participants:** [[Marten_Engblom|Mårten]], [[Jeff_Sherard|Jeff]]  
**Duration:** ~40 minutes

## Summary

Internal interview with Jeff Sherard for Principal Data Engineer role in automation pod. Jeff brings deep database expertise across multiple technologies and sees the role as bridging the gap between DBAs (focused on maintenance) and application engineers (ORM-heavy without data layer ownership). Key motivation: compensation alignment, focused scope on automation pod/CoreX, and bringing data engineering discipline to teams defaulting to inefficient ORM patterns.

## Role Vision & The Data Gap

- **Role created to bridge gap between:**
  - DBAs (container/maintenance focus)
  - Application engineers (ORM-heavy, no data layer ownership)
- **Core problem:** engineers default to ORM (Morphia, plain Java objects) with no query optimization instinct
  - "Select star from everywhere and wonder why it's slow"
  - Works fine at 10 objects in dev; breaks at 6TB in prod
- **Jeff's framing:** equivalent to a "Database Engineer" (DBE) role
  - Application-side, focused on query writing, schema design, data modeling
- **EA guidance too high-level** to solve ground-level problems like the audit DB abuse
  - EA says "transactional separated from reporting" — won't tell you whether 188M audit records/day belong in Mongo

## Current State of the Data Estate

- **~8–9 Mongo clusters** post-migration (Jeff's view: shouldn't need that many)
- **Automation pod portfolio:** Mongo, Elasticsearch, MySQL, Redis, DocumentDB, DynamoDB
- **Other pods:** self-hosted SQL Server on EC2 (Always On AGs), Oracle (Europe), various Mongo/Elastic implementations
  - SQL Server → RDS or Postgres migration in discussion
- **BT database:** 66 collections, not all related to business documents
- **Audit DB: 188M records/day, ~$100K/month** — storing everything forever by default
  - Root cause: "never lose a document" golden rule + customer demand for real-time 10-year access
  - **Estimate: ~10% of that data is actually meaningful**

## Prioritized Approach Jeff Would Take

1. **Full database fleet inventory** — ownership, performance, scalability, usage patterns, risk hotspots
2. **Continue migration and stabilization** to hosted databases (Atlas, Elastic)
3. **Optimization and modernization** — get 10 years of data out of transactional stores
   - Stream/offload to Common Data Platform (Snowflake) for reporting use cases
   - Audit data: consider Elasticsearch for queryable fields → pointer to full doc stored in S3/file system
   - MongoDB frozen tier / queryable backups as intermediate step (rehydrates in ~10 min)
4. **Microservice data layer split** — e.g., audit breaking into mailbox statistics, notifications, etc.
   - **Risk:** going too far → thousands of micro-databases with 10 records each, unmanageable to patch/maintain

## Jeff's Background & Motivations

- **Currently in shared services DB team:** spans 9 pods, multiple DB technologies
- **Active in AWS/Atlas/Elastic cost ops** (monthly analysis with [[Steve_Kirkpatrick|Steve]])
  - **70–80% of total AWS spend is Mårten's org**
- **Manages GHX India offshore team** and Happiest Minds managed services partner
  - Mentoring [[Ali_Inam|Ali]] as successor
- **Building "Project Jarvis"** — AI operating system for infrastructure team using Claude Code
- **Motivation for move:**
  - Compensation (no bonus in current role)
  - Focus (laser on automation pod / CoreX)
  - Market value alignment
- **Willing to leave current responsibilities behind** — sees Ali and Steve stepping up
- **Interested in bringing AI ambassador role** into the new org

## Action Items

### For Me

- [ ] Work with TA to set up abbreviated interview loop for Jeff ^task-20260406-001
- [ ] Follow up after Jeff tells Sean (current manager) about potential move ^task-20260406-002

### For Jeff

- [ ] Tell Sean this afternoon that he and Mårten talked and the move is a real possibility

## Key Technical Points

- Audit DB optimization is massive cost opportunity (~$100K/month)
- Need disciplined data modeling to prevent "select star" anti-patterns
- Fleet inventory would reveal ownership and risk hotspots
- Snowflake/CDP integration for reporting workloads is the right direction
