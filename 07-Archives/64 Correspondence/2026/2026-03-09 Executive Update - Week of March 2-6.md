## Weekly Executive Summary
**Week of March 2-6, 2026 | For: CTO**

Hello CJ,

Curtis had asked me to send periodic updates to you. With feedback on content, level of detail, etc. I'd be happy to adjust going forward. 

### TLDR
- Moving forward from Audit DB incident. New migration plan crystallizing with MongoDB support, working on full impact to Atlas migration schedule. Critical architectural improvements beyond quick fixes have emerged from this work.
- Hiring: Matured hiring process with Product team involvement and secured Director hire (Aaron Srivastava accepted).
- Q2 roadmap planning underway with Product; IPA team delivered impressive POC on document understanding/classification/extraction.

### Last week

- **Audit DB migration planning finalized** – Achieved alignment with DBAs and MongoDB on phased approach: immediate index optimizations + Atlas migration from 1 hosted cluster to multiple managed Atlas clusters (database splitting). This was a last-minute direction change instead of sharding based on further DB profiling and analysis.
	- Will reduce load significantly (spread it over 3 clusters instead of 1)
	- Will decouple some current unfortunate dependencies, most notably the SFTP mailbox database
	- Implementing application improvements in parallel
	- Still scrutinizing the plan, including the test plan
	- Overall impact to Atlas migration schedule is being assessed
	- Further update on this later in the week

- **Hiring & process maturation** – Significant work on streamlining the hiring process: defining process, documenting in one-stop-shop Confluence page, aligning with team and TA on new practices. Involved both Product and Curtis' wider org in the hiring process. Aaron Srivastava accepted offer for Director, Developer Platform & AI Enablement role. 

- **Q2 planning prep with Product** – Conducted honest assessment of Q1 progress and constraints; initiated roadmap discussions with team and Product partners.

### Coming up

- **Finalize Audit DB → Atlas migration execution plan** – Deliver crystal-clear plan this week with migration schedule and impact analysis.  

- **Q2 roadmap planning** – Complete planning with team and Product; Atlas migration and DR ([[Daniel_Milburn]] taking point) are key components alongside other strategic initiatives

- **Onboarding prep for Aaron** – Begin Director onboarding planning for new hire; align on initial priorities and team introductions

- **Continue interview pipeline** – Multiple interviews scheduled; finalize Principal Engineer - Data Architecture & Engineering JD for TA

- **Operational improvements** – Drive progress on KRs: all work in Jira, OSS vulnerabilities, VM hardening, Agile Maturity tracking, AI adoption survey

### Currently on my mind

- **DB scalability and usage patterns** – Audit DB incident validated the urgency of addressing database architecture and scaling concerns. 

- **Shifting team mindset toward architectural excellence** – Using Audit DB incident as catalyst to move beyond "duct tape and bubblegum" approach; need to embed this thinking more broadly (e.g., question current DB usage patterns, is MongoDB really the storage we should use in all situations).

- **Exchange org communications overdue** – Need to communicate new org structure and north star vision for Exchange. Behind schedule on this (was planned for last week); team needs clarity as transitions complete and hiring is underway.

- **Accelerating AI adoption** – IPA POC demo was impressive (document understanding/extraction); thinking about how to kindle more initiatives like this across the org.

- **Visibility & reporting gaps** – Getting all work (vulnerabilities, defects, incident RCAs) into Jira and establishing clean reporting is foundational for operating at scale and providing satisfactory reporting (e.g., to Chrystie). Need to move away from Excel-based roadmap dashboards.
